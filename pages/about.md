## About the Project

The collection content and map are subjective to University of Idaho student Vincent Lyon's experience using a lightweight electric wheelchair when navigating the sidewalks on the University of Idaho campus. Vincent graduated from the University of Idaho in 2024 with a Bachelors degree in Political Science. The collection was built by Vincent ÃŸwith assistance from Digital Scholarship Librarian Julia Stone. 

The photos and videos should be taken as one of many experiences when traversing the sidewalks on campus. Some may have a more manageable, complex, or similar experience, so the severity of a problem may differ for others.

In Vincent's words, "The Sidewalk Accessibility Collection intends to help potential or new students at the University of Idaho navigate campus using their mobility aids and know which areas to avoid or be cautious of. The collection also helps university entities understand these problems and raise awareness of barriers like sidewalks. The current collection contains 57 photos and videos of 14 sidewalks on campus. It is a continuous project that is open to change. "

## Problem Areas

This collection intends to highlight the problem areas and to aid other students with disabilities in navigating across campus. It also aims to highlight some of the more dangerous regions, especially in Sweet Avenue, Idaho Avenue, and different sections across the campus.
