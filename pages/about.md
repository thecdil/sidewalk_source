## About the Project

The collection content and map are subjective to University of Idaho student Vincent Lyon's experience using a lightweight electric wheelchair when navigating the sidewalks on the University of Idaho campus. The photos and videos should be taken as one of many experiences when traversing the sidewalks on campus. Some may have a more manageable, complex, or similar experience, so the severity of a problem may differ for others.

## Problem Areas

This collection intends to highlight the problem areas and to aid other students with disabilities in navigating across campus. It also aims to highlight some of the more dangerous regions, especially in Sweet Avenue, Idaho Avenue, and different sections across the campus.
